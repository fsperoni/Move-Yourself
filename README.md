# Move-Yourself
The Move Yourself project uses React.JS, Next.JS and TypeScript. Move Yourself tracks time the user spends in front of the computer and proposes challenges every 20 minutes. Challenges include stretching, blinking and more. Upon challenge completion, user gains experience points (XP) and eventually increase level, an analogy to role playing games (RPG).
